The dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv).
See this [data dictionary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000) to understand the dataset's variables.


## Summary of Findings

My exploration of the dataset showed that the loan amounts that are offered by
Prosper take on a wide range between \\$2,000 and \\$50,000. The distribution
of loan amounts taken also shows some loan amounts are quite popular (roughly
multiples of \\$5,000. The highest number of investors to fund a single loan
was a little above 1000 and there is a dense cluster of investors for loans
of lower amounts, this makes sense as these investments are less risky. There
are more active loans than loans in other phases and Debt consolidation is the
most popular type of loan. This shows a strong culture among borrowers as they
are more likely to take more loans to pay off existing debts. The occupation of
the borrowers didn't reveal any special significant trend from my analysis.

Interestingly though, the ratings asigned to borrowers alone might not be a good
indication of whether the borrower will come through with paying off the loan as
ratings of all levels were well represented in all the phases of loans.



## Key Insights for Presentation

My presentation focuses on the investment aspect of the loan business. First I
look at the loan amounts, then the categories listed and the performance of the
peer-to-peer lending brooker Prosper over the years since they started operation.
Next I explore the performance of borrowers as regards loan repayment. The Visualizations
I used focuses on showing plots in a ready and easy to interpret manner. Appropriate
type of plots, transformations, encoding of data, and correct formatting (title,
axis-labels) where necessary.
